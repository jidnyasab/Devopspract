Network Security 

Pillars of Security : Confidentiality   
CIA Tria              Intergrity
                      Availibility
Integrity : protecting info from unauthorized modification : integrity is enforced using Hashing 
                                                             access control
Security Threats : Untrained personal ,script kiddies ,hackers, insiders,nations,
Security Vulnerabilities : Lack of Strong Passwords
                           Lack of Malware removal tools
                           Poor access controls                         
Authorization : a way to determine what resource an entity can access
Accountability : a way to record your actions
                 user - identification athentication - authorization- Accountability record
Non- Repudation : Someone cannot deny their actions later on
STRIDE MODEL : SPOOFING - Someone tries to steal your identity - Secu property attacked : authenticity
               TAMPERING - Unauthorization modification - Integrity
               REPUDATION - denial of action - non-repudation
               INFO DISCLOSURE - confidentiality
               DENIAL OF SERVICE - services unavailable - availability
               EVALUATION OF PRIVILEGE - attacker tries to get priviliages-authoriazation
TYPES OF ATTACKS : ACTIVE-Disrupts the system by sending several manipulated inputs
                   a) Replay Attack-replaying song-captures packets-stores-sends
                   b) Denial of Services (DOS) Attack- Overloads the system-soln firewall
                   c) Fabrication attack -alter the behaviour  of the system,email spoofing-soln redunduncy check

                   PASSIVE-DOES NOT ALTER INFO & SILENTLY PERFORMS MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES-gathering of information to                                                                                          plan something
                   a)Traffic Analysis
                   b)Eavesdropping- is like over hearing someone
OSI MODEL :         Open system interconnection 
SECURITY SERVICES : Authentication ,access control, Data Confidentiality, Data interity, Non-repudiation

NETWORK SECURITY MODEL(NSM) : physical-physical aspects router,switch-security alarms , guards CCTV

ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES : 1.SUBSTITUTION A)monoalphabetic -Ceaser cipher, b) Polyalphabetic-Vignere cipher
                                                                 playfair-symmetric key
                        2.TRANSPOSITION a)Keyed B)keyless
                                        Hill cipher-linear algebra
STEANOGRAPHY :      Hidding a message within another
CRYPTOGRPHY  :       info is transformed                          steganography - info is hidden
                   provides confidentilty,integrity                             only confidentiality

Cryptography: Key Management ,Distribution & User Authentication

METHODS OD ENCRYPTION : 1) Symmetric key based- encrypt de crypt same key 
                        2) Asymmetric key based- 2 keys used 1 encrytptn decryptn ,Eg RSA
SYMMETRIC ALGORITHM/CIPHER :1) Block cipher - info is broken in equal no of blocks ,eg DES AES RC5
                            2) Stream cipher - work on one-bit at a time ,eg.RC4
DATA eNCRYPTION TECHNIQUE (DES) :Symmetric key based block cipher for encrptn decryptn -block size 64 bits
                                 Crptographic stenght low- key size 56 bits
ADVANCE ENCRPTION TECNIQUE (AES) : Symmetric key based block cipher for encrptn decryptn -block size 128 bits
                                   Crptographic stenght high- key size ,128 256 bits
RC5(RIVEST CIPHER) :       BLOCK size 32,64
EULIDS ALGORITHM :            GCD OF LARGE NOS.
PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY :       2 KEYS ,private public
RSA :           Asymmetric key based algoritm used for confidentiality ,integrity, non repudation 
                Key leng  1024 -309    2048-617      4096 - 1233
 
CRYPTOLYSIS : 1)Ciphertext only attack
              2) known plain tecxt attack
              3) Chosen plaintext attack   4)Chosen ciphertext attac
              4) Differntial cryptolysis 6)Linear
MESSAGE AUTHENTIFICATION FUNCTION :  1.HASHING - process finding  a unique message digest
                                       Characteristics : one way only ,any leng input,fixed lenght output
                                     2. Message Encryption  3. Message Authentification Code (MAC)
HASH FUNCTIONS  :   SHA-1 -NOT Approved for use-Secure hash Algorithm 1 -cryptographic hash function produces 160                                                                              bit value for input
                    SHA-2 - approved - 
                    SHA-3 - approved -Secure hash Algorithm 3-most secure against collision
MAC (MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE) :  Confirms the message came from the stated sender & has nor been changed -protects                                      integrity and authenticity - keyed hash -three types oF MAC....
HMAC (HASH MAC)          : Hashing func used as MAC to calcu MAC value -MD5,SHA-1 
CBC MAC                  :   mess is encryp with symm block cipher in th CBC mode ,output of final block of ciphertext                              is used a MAC
CMAC (CIPHER BASED MAC)  : symm block cipher encrption used as mac func to cal mac value

DIGITAL SIGNATURE   : mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document.
